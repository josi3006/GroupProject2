# SpotiFeels

SpotiFeels... the app that lets you choose your mood, then serves up the perfect playlist to suit your feels.

Team SpotiFeels is John Sims, Patrick McDowell, Zach Sadovszky and Alex Tan Phan.  We're using the Spotify API to generate a library of titles which the user rates for mood.  Later, the user can choose a mood, then the app will serve songs to match that feel.  Users can also post comments/reviews of individual songs.
